As for the Red Wings, this makes general manager Ken Holland look like an even-keeled, 
benevolent despot. He's letting Babcock take a gander around. If he wants to come back, 
great. If he doesn't, he did the 'honorable' thing to give Babs his shot at free agency. 
If Babcock wants to go, this at least gives him time to move his family and start the 
process of building with a new team.
